Code Cracker Version 1.0

 This is a simple code breaking type game I whipped up in a couple of days to help out beginning
programmers who are learning the basics.  I used only a few functions in the custom.bas file to keep confusion to a minimum and show how they are done.  I used no arrays so people could see a fun windows game can be written using only the basics.  If you know how to use If-Then statements you'll understand the code.  Everything is heavly commented to help you under stand the logic flow of the game.  Please don't flame me about how much more "optimized" the code could have been cause I didn't plan it out before writing it and I wanted to keep the code at a beginners level.  I hope someone can learn a few things from this I enjoy helping out.
